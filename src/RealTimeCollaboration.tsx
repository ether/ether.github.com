        <h5 className="subheading">No more sending your stuff back and forth via email, just set up a pad, share the
            link and start collaborating!</h5>
        <p>Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time, much like a live multi-player editor that
            runs in your browser. Write articles, press releases, to-do lists, etc. together with your friends, fellow
            students or colleagues, all working on the same document at the same time.</p>
        <p>All instances provide access to all data through a well-documented API and support import/export to many
            major data exchange formats. And if the built-in feature set isn't enough for you, there's tons of plugins
            that allow you to customize your instance to suit your needs.</p>

        <p>You don't need to set up a server and install Etherpad in order to use it. Just <a href="#links">pick</a> one
            of the publicly available instances that friendly people from everywhere around the world have set up.
            Alternatively, you can set up your own instance by following our <a
                href="https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite#installation">installation guide</a>.</p>
